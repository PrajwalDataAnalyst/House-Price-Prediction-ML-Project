üè°üìà Exciting News! My latest project, the "Bangalore House Price Prediction" model, is now live and deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)!

As a data analyst passionate about real estate trends, I embarked on this project to leverage machine learning techniques and data analysis to predict house prices in Bangalore, India. Beginning with small steps into the data world, I delved into extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and cloud services like GCP. After diligent efforts, I'm thrilled to share the results.
